# State Management

Phonely provides robust state management capabilities that allow your applications to maintain context across multiple user interactions. This guide explains how to leverage state management effectively.

## Understanding State in Phonely

State in Phonely refers to the persistent information maintained between API calls. This allows your application to create natural, flowing conversations with users without losing context.

<Note>
  State management is available on all subscription tiers but with different retention periods based on your plan.
</Note>

## Session State

Session state is automatically maintained for a configurable time period (default: 30 minutes) and is identified by a unique session ID.

<CodeGroup>
```json Example Session Creation
{
  "model": "phonely-fast-1",
  "create_session": true,
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello, I'd like to book a flight to Paris"
  }]
}
```

```json Response with Session ID
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-abc123",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'd be happy to help you book a flight to Paris. When would you like to travel, and from which city will you be departing?"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Continuing the Conversation

To continue a conversation within the same session, include the `session_id` in subsequent requests:

<CodeGroup>
```json Continuation Request
{
  "model": "phonely-fast-1",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I'll be traveling from New York on July 15th"
  }]
}
```

```json Continuation Response
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-def456",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Great! Would you prefer a morning or evening flight from New York to Paris on July 15th? And is this a one-way trip, or will you need a return flight as well?"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Persistent Variables

In addition to the automatic message history, you can store specific variables that will persist throughout the session:

<CodeGroup>
```json Setting Variables
{
  "model": "phonely-fast-1",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "variables": {
    "departure_city": "New York",
    "destination": "Paris",
    "departure_date": "2024-07-15",
    "user_preference": "evening flights"
  },
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I prefer evening flights, by the way"
  }]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## State Expiration

By default, session state expires after 30 minutes of inactivity. You can configure this by specifying a `state_ttl` in seconds:

<CodeGroup>
```json Custom State TTL
{
  "model": "phonely-fast-1",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "state_ttl": 3600,
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "I'll be back in an hour to finalize my booking"
  }]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Manually Clearing State

To explicitly clear a session's state:

<CodeGroup>
```json Clear State
{
  "model": "phonely-fast-1",
  "session_id": "sess_xyz789",
  "clear_state": true,
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Let's start over with a new booking"
  }]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maintain Session IDs Client-Side">
    Store session IDs securely on your client side to resume conversations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle Session Expiration">
    Implement graceful fallbacks for when sessions expire.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Variables for Critical Information">
    Store important user data in variables rather than relying on the model to extract it from conversation history.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider Privacy Implications">
    Be thoughtful about what data you store in session state, especially sensitive information.
  </Accordion>
