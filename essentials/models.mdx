## Model Details

### phonely-fast-1

<Attributes>
  <Attribute name="Context Length" value="16K tokens" />
  <Attribute name="Training Data" value="Up to December 2023" />
  <Attribute name="Strengths" value="General purpose, low latency, high throughput" />
  <Attribute name="Pricing" value="$0.50 per million tokens" />
</Attributes>

Our primary model balances speed and quality for most general-purpose applications. Ideal for chat interfaces, content generation, and applications where responsiveness is crucial.

### phonely-fast-2

<Attributes>
  <Attribute name="Context Length" value="32K tokens" />
  <Attribute name="Training Data" value="Up to March 2024" />
  <Attribute name="Strengths" value="Advanced reasoning, code generation, longer context" />
  <Attribute name="Pricing" value="$0.80 per million tokens" />
</Attributes>

An enhanced version of our base model with improved reasoning capabilities and longer context window. Best for complex tasks requiring deeper understanding and memory.

### phonely-compact

<Attributes>
  <Attribute name="Context Length" value="8K tokens" />
  <Attribute name="Training Data" value="Up to December 2023" />
  <Attribute name="Strengths" value="Lightweight, edge deployment, low resource usage" />
  <Attribute name="Pricing" value="$0.25 per million tokens" />
</Attributes>

Optimized for edge deployment and resource-constrained environments. Maintains good quality while requiring significantly less computational resources.

### phonely-vision

<Attributes>
  <Attribute name="Context Length" value="16K tokens + 16 images" />
  <Attribute name="Training Data" value="Up to March 2024" />
  <Attribute name="Strengths" value="Image understanding, multimodal reasoning" />
  <Attribute name="Pricing" value="$1.20 per million tokens + $0.02 per image" />
</Attributes>

Our multimodal model capable of processing both text and images. Ideal for applications requiring visual understanding alongside text comprehension.

## Model Selection

Choosing the right model depends on your specific use case:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consider your latency requirements">
    If ultra-low latency is critical, phonely-fast-1 or phonely-compact are your best options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate context needs">
    For applications requiring longer context or more complex reasoning, phonely-fast-2 is recommended.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for multimodal requirements">
    If your application needs to process images alongside text, phonely-vision is required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balance cost and performance">
    For cost-sensitive applications, phonely-compact offers the best price-performance ratio.
  </Step>
</Steps>
